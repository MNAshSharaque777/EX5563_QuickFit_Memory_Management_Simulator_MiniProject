Quick Fit Memory Management Simulator

Welcome to the Quick Fit Memory Management Simulator repository! This is a Java-based GUI application that demonstrates the Quick Fit memory allocation strategy by simulating memory allocation and deallocation processes. Designed with Java Swing, the application provides a simple, interactive interface to visualize memory block management.



üìú Overview
The Quick Fit Memory Management Simulator allows users to allocate and deallocate memory blocks while monitoring their status in real time. It uses predefined memory block sizes to mimic memory management strategies and provides insights into allocation status.



üöÄ Features
View Memory Status: Check the number of free memory blocks available for each predefined memory size.
Allocate Memory Block: Simulate memory allocation by selecting a specific memory block size.
Deallocate Memory Block: Simulate freeing memory blocks by specifying the block size.
Error Handling: Handles invalid inputs with user-friendly error messages.
Interactive GUI: An intuitive interface built using Java Swing to simplify user interactions.


üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
Programming Language: Java
GUI Framework: Swing
Core Functionality: Memory block simulation, allocation, deallocation, and visualization



üì• Installation
Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure you have the following:

Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans is recommended (optional but preferred).

java MemoryManagerApp


üíª How to Use
Launch the application by running MemoryManagerApp.java.
The GUI window will display options:
Display Memory Status: View the status of all free memory blocks.
Allocate Block: Allocate a memory block of your choice (32 KB, 64 KB, 128 KB, 256KB, 512KB).
Deallocate Block: Free a memory block by specifying the size.
Exit: Close the application.
Follow prompts and input block sizes as instructed.
